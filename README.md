# FINAL PROJECT ROS

## Authors
- Marc Zoel Arias
- Arnau Boix

## Structure of the code
The code is divided into five main packages:

1. sensing
2. planning
3. action
4. chesslab_setup 
5. ros2223-final-project

Each package has it's own README file where their content is explained.

In order to execute the proposed solution, the "action.launch" file from the action package should be executed.

NOTE: We have had problems including the chesslab_setup package inside this folder. For that reason, the one we have used is located in the main directory of our work (intro2ros/2023/team03).
